# Airline Performance Analysis: My Power BI Project Documentation

## What This Project Is About

This project is all about using Microsoft Power BI to deep-dive into airline data. I created interactive dashboards to help understand things like passenger bookings, flight statuses, and overall how the airline is doing. The detailed process and findings are documented in a PDF report.

## Why I Built This (Problem Solved)

Airlines have tons of data, but it's hard to make quick decisions without a clear overview. I built this project to give them a straightforward, visual summary of their operations. It helps them spot trends, find potential problems, and ultimately improve how they run flights and keep customers happy.

## What I Did (Key Features)

* **Data Transformation:** I took raw airline data and cleaned and shaped it in Power BI (using Power Query) to get it ready for analysis.
* **Metric Calculation (DAX):** I used Power BI's powerful formula language (DAX) to calculate important numbers like total passenger bookings, on-time performance rates, and more.
* **Interactive Dashboards:** I designed and built user-friendly dashboards with various charts, graphs, and tables. These dashboards cover key areas like flight operations and customer insights.
* **Dynamic Analysis:** I set up filters and drill-down options so users can explore the data in detail, looking at specific routes, dates, or passenger types.
* **Reporting:** My goal was to create reports that could be easily shared and understood by different teams within an airline.

## Tools I Used

* **Microsoft Power BI Desktop** (My primary tool for this project)
* **Power Query** (For data cleaning and transformation within Power BI)
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** (For creating custom measures and calculations)

## How You Can View This

The detailed analysis, dashboard designs, and insights from this Power BI project are thoroughly documented in a PDF file.

1.  **Get My Project File:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/nayan9572/airline-performance-powerbi.git](https://github.com/nayan9572/airline-performance-powerbi.git)
    cd airline-performance-powerbi
    ```
2.  **Open the PDF Report:**
    * Find the PDF file (e.g., `power bi project.pdf` or similar, ensure it's named clearly in your repo) in the downloaded folder.
    * Open it with any PDF viewer (like Adobe Acrobat Reader or your web browser).
    * The PDF will walk you through the entire project, including screenshots of the dashboards and explanations of the analysis.

## My Results and What I Learned

* I gained really good insights into passenger booking patterns, ticket statuses, and flight performance trends.
* This project helped me identify potential areas where airlines could make improvements in their operations and customer service.
* I significantly improved my skills in creating professional, dynamic, and insightful reports using Power BI, from data loading to advanced visualization and DAX. I also honed my ability to document complex analytical projects.
